ShitAppens
==========

* We track actions which happen at the restroom, not only in the [c-base](http://c-base.de/).
* This project was started at the [DevFest / V Hack Android](http://logbuch.c-base.org/archives/1934)
weekend taking place in Berlin at October 12./13., 2012.
* The server backend for the mobile client can be found in a [separate repository](https://github.com/johnjohndoe/ShitAppensRails).


Our main goal
-------------

* See which toilet is used, and which is free
* Is the toilet paper nearly gone? send a push message to the responsible person
* 3 toilets - which toilet is the most visited toilet? (and where are maybe more viruses?)
* What is the average toilet time?
* How much cost a toilet visit?
* How many male persons are visiting the female toilets (and vice versa)

What you can do
---------------

* See, if a toilet is free?
* See which toilet is the most visited toilet of the day (and which is the least visited toilet (remember the viruses)!!
* Highscore (longest visit, fastest visit)

Dependencies
